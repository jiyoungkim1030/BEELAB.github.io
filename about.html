									<p>The BEE Lab is lead by Dr. Ji Young Kim who is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Penn State Harrisburg and a doctoral-level Board Certified Behavior Analyst. Dr. Kim earned her Ph.D. and M.A. in Applied Behavior Analysis at Teachers College, Columbia University, and her B.A. in Psychology at Barnard College, Columbia University. As a doctoral student, Dr. Kim worked as a full-time teacher in an inclusion classroom at a public school and has over 5 years of experience in K-5 education working with individuals with and without disabilities and their families. She has published in peer-reviewed journals, and her work has been recognized through numerous awards and grants including the APA Division 25 SEAB Applied Behavior Analysis Dissertation Award, NYSABA research award for two consecutive years, and the SABA Sidney W. and Janet R. Bijou Grant.</p>
									<p>Dr. Kim is interested in understanding decision-making and developing effective procedures to enhance learning for individuals with and without developmental disabilities. Her research focuses on the application of behavioral economics concepts to education and other socially significant behaviors. Dr. Kim is also passionate about exploring the intersection between verbal behavior and decision-making behavior.</p>
									<p>Our lab explores the intersection between behavioral economics and education. This means that we use science to study individuals' decision-making behavior in terms of socially significant everyday and eduacational beahviors. Topics we look at include:</p>
									<p>&#9830 Decision-making</p>
									<p>&#9830 Application of Behavioral Economics</p>
									<p>&#9830 Self-Control and Impulsivity</p>
									<p>&#9830 Efficient Instruction</p>
